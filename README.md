# CitySort-1000
https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/project-7-48t5jv

My application is titled CitySort 1000, which takes the top 1000 most populated US cities from an endpoint, puts it into a list, and allows the user to sort it by specific criteria. At the top of the website there is a bar chart showing the top 10 cities based on what is currently listed, which you can hover your cursor over and see the population. For each city/entry on the list, whatâ€™s listed is the name of the city, the state, the population, and the rank, alongside a search box allowing users to find a specific location. There is also a drop down menu which allows you to sort by either population, rank, or name (city) and name (state).
